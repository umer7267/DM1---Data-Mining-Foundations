### Data Semantics
  * Introduce the variables with their meaning and characteristics;
### Distribution of the variables and statistics
  * Explore (single, pairs ofâ€¦) variables quantitatively (e.g., statistics, distributions);
### Assessing data quality
  * Are present errors, outliers, missing values, semantic inconsistencies, etc?
### Variable transformations
  * Is it better to use for further modules transformed variables (e.g., log transformation)?
### Pairwise correlations and eventual elimination of variables
  * Matrix correlation (analyze highly correlated variables);
