#### Classification of at least 1 target variable of your choice:
  * by Decision Trees;
  * by KNN;
  * by Naive Bayes.
You should discuss the choice of the attributes and identify the best parameter
configurations (e.g. gain criterion for trees, best k for KNN etc.).

#### Discussion
  * Evaluate the quantitative performance of the algorithms w.r.t. confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC curve
  * Discuss some insight (e.g. try to interpret the tree(s))
  * Which is the best algorithm? Best can be studied w.r.t. the performance evaluation or other preferred point of view;
