### Analysis by centroid-based methods
  * K-Means (mandatory), Bisecting K-Means (optional), X-Means (optional);
  * Choice the attributes, identify the best value of k, and discuss the clusters.
### Analysis by density-based clustering
  * DBSCAN (mandatory), OPTICS (optional);
  * Choice the attributes, identify the best parameter configuration, and discuss clusters.
### Analysis by hierarchical clustering
  * Choice the attributes, the distance function, and analyze several dendrograms.
### Final discussion
  * Which is the best algorithm? Remember that best is studied w.r.t. several aggregate statistics, cluster distributions, and w.r.t. the typology of the algorithm used for that particular dataset;
